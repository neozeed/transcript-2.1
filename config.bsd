#
# this is a shell script that get's "sourced" when building and
# installing TranScript software.  It sets up definitions of the
# places that TranScript wants to do it's work.
# This script is concerned with the software itself, not with
# the printers.  Another script (???) is used to configure printers.
#
# If you change the values in this script, parts of the TranScript
# system may need to be remade (recompiled), and reinstalled.

# BINDIR
#	This is a directory where TranScript user programs are put.
#	It should be in the PATH of each user that want's to use them.
#	Many UNIX sites will keep these kinds of programs separate
#	from the regular UNIX utilites but in a well-known spot, like
#	"/usr/local/bin", "/usr/local", etc.  Whatever you choose,
#	make sure it's in people's search paths.  The TranScript
#	installation sequence will write in this directory.
BINDIR=/usr/bin

# PSLIBDIR
#	This is a directory where TranScript keeps lots of things:.
#	spooler interface filters, font metrics files, prologue files,
#	and executables needed by TranScript or administrators, but not
#	by general users.
PSLIBDIR=/usr/lib/ps

# OWNER GROUP
#	User and group names for installed files
#	On BSD systems, this is typically "root" and "staff"
OWNER=root
GROUP=staff

# PSTEMPDIR
#	The temporary directory you want TranScript filters to use
#	when necessary.  Sometimes this may need to hold a large print
#	file, so choose a tmp directory on a filesystem with enough
#	space.
PSTEMPDIR=/usr/tmp

# MAN1 MAN7 MAN8
#	The places you want the on-line manual pages installed.
#	If you want them all in the same place, 
#	(e.g., /usr/man/manl), set them all to that.
MAN1=/usr/man/man1
MAN7=/usr/man/man7
MAN8=/usr/man/man8

# DITDIR
#	This directory will contain the font family directories that
#	are used by "psroff" and "psdit".
#	DITDIR/Times/devpsc will contain the default font info.
#	DON'T make it /usr/lib/font/devpsc!
DITDIR=$PSLIBDIR/ditroff.font

# MAKEDEV 
#	is the FULL pathname of the makedev program for ditroff
#	(for Berkeley ditroff, this file is called "devconfig")
#	You may have to go hunting to find it (maybe even recompile it)
#	If you do not have ditroff (i.e., don't have makedev), set 
#	DITROFFFONTS=0 (see below).
MAKEDEV=/usr/bin/makedev

# TROFFFONTDIR
#	This directory will contain the font family directories that
#	are used by "ptroff" and "pscat".
#	TROFFFONTDIR/Times will contain the default font info.
#	DON'T make it /usr/lib/font if you can help it!
TROFFFONTDIR=$PSLIBDIR/troff.font

# BANNERFIRST BANNERLAST
#	These determine the default actions to take with job banner pages.
#	These pages (printed by the spooler to identify a job) may
#	be printed either before the job itself, after the job, or both,
#	or neither.  Note that this is the site-wide default.
#	These values can be overridden for specific printers using the
#	.options file in the spool directory (see documentation).
#	Limitations in the spooler make it difficult to print a trailing
#	banner correctly. Therefore BANNERLAST may have the following values:
#	  0: Do not print a trailing banner.
#	  1: Print a trailing banner after EACH copy when multiple copies
#	     are specified.  WARNING: This will print the banner from the
#	     previous job when a lpr -h (no header) job is printed.
#	  2: Print trailing banners, except for lpr -h jobs.  WARNING: 
#	     The trailing banner is printed only after the FIRST copy when
#	     multiple copies are requested.
BANNERFIRST=0
BANNERLAST=1

# REVERSE
#	This indicates the program that should be used to automatically
#	reverse the page order in a user job.  It is used with printers
#	that pile pages "face up".  To specify that no reversal should be
#	done, use the REVERSE= line instead.  Note that this is the site-wide
#	default.  This value can be overridden for specific printers using the
#	.options file in the spool directory (see documentation).
#	If this value is set, you will probably want banners to be
#	printer AFTER the job is printed (BANNERLAST).
REVERSE=$PSLIBDIR/psrv
#REVERSE=

# VERBOSELOG
#	Indicates that verbose job logging should take place in the 
#	printer log files.  It can be reset on a per-printer basis,
#	so don't worry about it here.
VERBOSELOG=1

# SETCFLAGS
#	Lists the flags that are to be passed to the "C" compiler (cc)
#	whenever a program is compiled.
SETCFLAGS="-O -DBSD"

# DITROFFFONTS
#	Indicates that ditroff fonts should be installed.  It is
#	difficult to install fonts at a later date, so it is recommended
#	that this be left on unless the user is sure that ditroff will
#	never be used.  This option is provided because the fonts can
#	take up quite a bit of disk space.  See below.
#	Note that the user must have the makedev program in order to
#	build ditroff fonts.  If you don't have makedev, turn this off.
DITROFFFONTS=1

# TROFFFONTS
#	Indicates that troff (otroff) fonts should be installed.  It is
#	difficult to install fonts at a later date, so it is recommended
#	that this be left on unless the user is sure that otroff will
#	never be used.  This option is provided because the fonts can
#	take up quite a bit of disk space.  See below.
TROFFFONTS=1

# FONTFAMILIES
#	List of the troff/ditroff font families to install.  This sets
#	up the fonts that will be available in troff/ditroff.  Any font
#	that is NOT in this list will not be available AT ALL, barring
#	difficult manual intervention later.  The default is set up for
#	the standard 13 fonts: the Times, Helvetica, and Courier families,
#	and the Symbol font.  Other font families may be added.  Each font
#	FAMILY takes about 35 KB of disk space for ditroff, and 20 KB for
#	troff.  You may wish to check the documentation for the PostScript
#	printer(s) at your site to determine which fonts to install.
#	If all font are installed, about 450 KB of disk space is used.
#	NOTE: Make sure that ALL values of FONTFAMILIES are commented out
#	except one.
#	Recognized font family names are:
#	AvantGarde  Bookman    Courier   Garamond   Helvetica  HelvNarrow
#	Lubalin     NewCentury Optima    Palatino   Souvenir   Times
#	HelvNarrow = Helvetica-Narrow
#	NewCentury = NewCenturySchlbk
#	Standard13 = Courier, Helvetica, Times, and Symbol
#	Zapf2      = ZapfChancery-MediumItalic
#	The families in most PostScript printers:
FONTFAMILIES=Standard13
#	All the font families that were shipped:
# FONTFAMILIES="Standard13 HelvNarrow AvantGarde Bookman Garamond Lubalin NewCentury Optima Palatino Souvenir Zapf2"
#	The families in many "plus" PostScript printers.
# FONTFAMILIES="Standard13 AvantGarde Bookman HelvNarrow NewCentury Palatino Zapf2"
#	DEC printers:
# FONTFAMILIES="Standard13 AvantGarde Lubalin NewCentury Souvenir"
#	AB Dick printers:
# FONTFAMILIES="Standard13 Bookman Garamond Optima Palatino Souvenir Zapf2"

# DITROFFDIRS
#	Indicates that separate directories should be created, which support
#	the new -F option in psroff.  This should be selected
#	unless the target system is tight on disk space and/or inodes.
#	Each new font family takes about 35 KB of disk space, and 20 inodes.
#	This disk usage is in addition to the space used by fonts in the
#	FONTFAMILIES installation above.  If all font families have been
#	installed, these will use an additional 450 KB, or about 900 KB
#	total for all the ditroff font families.
DITROFFDIRS=1

# PATH
#	The list of directories that is searched in order to run programs.
#	This is explained in the /bin/sh documentation.  If the installation
#	aborts because certain system programs cannot be found, change this
#	entry to include the correct directories, and follow the directions
#	for re-running the installation.  Be especially careful to look at
#	the PATH for "root", since much of the installation is run under
#	that account.  It is OK to have directories in the list twice, and
#	to have non-existent directories in the PATH.  The PATH below adds
#	the directories that are most often left out. It is VERY IMPORTANT
#	that "." be in the PATH.
