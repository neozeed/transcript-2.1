Software Problems
.LP
Contact us if your \*(TS shipment is correct and is properly installed but:
.IP \(bu
You suspect some sort of bug in the software.
.IP \(bu
\*(TS software does something surprising or contrary to the
nature of one of the document preparation systems you are 
using (e.g., \fItroff\fP), your operating system, or your
expectations.
.IP \(bu

.IP \(bu

\*(TS Software Maintenance
.LP
Bug reports and questions
are addressed by Adobe Systems.  \*(TS software is structured such that
``work around'' solutions are often easy to implement, and many problems can be
solved by simply changing a \*(PS prologue or modifying the font databases
without access to \*(TS sources.
.LP
When major enhancements or new functionality is added to the \*(TS software,
you will be notified that a new version of \*(TS software is available.
.NH
Adobe's Response to You
.IP \(bu
We will correct any problems that occurred in shipping the \*(TS product
to you, and help with problems you may encounter in installation and
testing.
.IP \(bu
We will answer questions on how to install and use \*(TS software.
Note we are not experts or wizards on the various document 
formats (e.g., \fItroff\fP, \fIplot\fP) supported by \*(TS, nor are
we necessarily experts on all the different varieties of UNIX systems.
The best source for information on
the document preparation systems themselves is the UNIX manual and
associated Bell Laboratories papers.  
We \fIdo\fP want to know of your problems and concerns.  We are especially
interested in knowing if our documentation fails to meet your needs,
so we can improve it.
.IP \(bu
When you encounter a problem and notify us with a Customer Comment Form and
supporting materials, 
we will try to get back to you with solutions as soon as possible.
We will provide the most complete information possible:
work-around solutions, prologue patches, or simply correction of
misunderstandings about \*(PS printers or the \*(TS software.
.IP \(bu
We will try to handle any other questions or problems that affect your
use of Adobe products.
