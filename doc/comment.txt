We can respond best to your problems if you  follow  these  guidelines
when reporting them:

o+    Limit each Customer Comment Form to one problem or subject.

o+    Try to isolate the problem to a small example - ten line examples
     are easier to deal with than 100 line ones.

o+    Include an actual script of the session exhibiting  the  problem.
     (Machine generated listings are preferable to hand typed ones.)

o+    Include a machine readable form of all relevant materials (please
     tell us its format).

Use this form or a facsimile, and attach extra  sheets  if  necessary.
Please provide us with the following information:
