DOCUMENTATION NOTES


The sources for a number of the TranScript package documents is provided
in this directory.  Normally, it is recommended that one use troff with
the -ms macros to print these out.

If you don't have troff, or it is not working, you can spool the .txt
version of the document, which is output for a simple line-printer
type device.  If your TranScript spooling software is working, it can
print these files, since they are normal ASCII text files.  NOTE: The
formatting and spacing of these files may be confusing, since the files
were set up to print well using troff.
