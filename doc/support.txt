o+    Your TRANSCRIPT software shipment arrived damaged or incomplete.

o+    Your TRANSCRIPT magnetic media cannot be read.

o+    Your TRANSCRIPT software does not compile, install, or test prop-
     erly.

We will need to verify the order in question so that we may ship a
replacement.

Contact us if your TRANSCRIPT shipment is correct and is properly
installed but:

o+    You suspect some sort of bug in the software.

o+    TRANSCRIPT software does something surprising or contrary to the
     nature of one of the document preparation systems you are using
     (e.g., _t_r_o_f_f), your operating system, or your expectations.

o+    You find a serious problem in the documentation or supporting
     materials.

o+    You encounter any other difficulty while using TRANSCRIPT
     software.

Adobe provides a 90 day warranty on the TRANSCRIPT product.

Bug reports and questions are addressed by Adobe Systems.  TRANSCRIPT
software is structured such that ``work around'' solutions are often
easy to implement, and many problems can be solved by simply changing
a POSTSCRIPT prologue or modifying the font databases without access
to TRANSCRIPT sources.

When major enhancements or new functionality is added to the TRAN-
SCRIPT software, you will be notified that a new version of TRANSCRIPT
software is available.

o+    We will correct any problems that occurred in shipping the TRAN-
     SCRIPT product to you, and help with problems you may encounter
     in installation and testing.

o+    We will answer questions on how to install and use TRANSCRIPT
     software.  Note we are not experts or wizards on the various
     document formats (e.g., _t_r_o_f_f, _p_l_o_t) supported by TRANSCRIPT, nor
     are we necessarily experts on all the different varieties of UNIX
     systems.  The best source for information on the document
     preparation systems themselves is the UNIX manual and associated
     Bell Laboratories papers. We _d_o want to know of your problems and

     concerns.  We are especially interested in knowing if our docu-
     mentation fails to meet your needs, so we can improve it.

o+    When you encounter a problem and notify us with a Customer Com-
     ment Form and supporting materials, we will try to get back to
     you with solutions as soon as possible.  We will provide the most
     complete information possible: work-around solutions, prologue
     patches, or simply correction of misunderstandings about
     POSTSCRIPT printers or the TRANSCRIPT software.

o+    We will try to handle any other questions or problems that affect
     your use of Adobe products.



     We welcome your comments.  We are excited about the func-
     tionality and freedom that Adobe products bring to the world
     of electronic printing.  Let us know how our products can be
     improved and how we can better serve you.
