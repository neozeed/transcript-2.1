.SH NAME
TRANSCRIPT \- Programs for accessing  P\s-2OST\s+2S\s-2CRIPT\s+2 printers
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \*(TS package is a suite of UNIX programs that enables
UNIX systems to access state-of-the-art \*(PS printers.
The package transforms UNIX documents and graphics files
into \*(PS format.
The \*(PS language is a device-independent programming language and print
file format for describing the appearance of printed pages. \*(PS
documents can combine text, graphics, line art, and scanned images
for printing on raster devices.  \*(PS files will print
.I without modification
on any \*(PS printer.
.sp
The \*(TS package includes
translator filters for
common UNIX document file formats like
.IR troff ,
.IR ditroff ,
and
.IR plot .
It also includes filters for ''line-printer'' listings,
Diablo 630 print files, and Tektronix 4014 files.
\*(TS software is fully integrated into the
spooling architecture, and includes the communications filters
necessary to print job banner pages, do page accounting,
and perform full RS232 communication with a \*(PS printer.
