% This file specifies a correspondence table for 
% the troff (C/A/T) to PostScript translator.
% It gets read and "compiled" by other programs into other forms.
% The Makefile will do all the work for us.
%
% Lines beginning with a percent sign (like this one) are comments
% and are ignored as are blank lines.

% ROMAN, ITALIC, BOLD are used for characters that are in the
% Roman, Italic, and Bold fonts respectively.

% SYMBOL is for characters not in the above (like degree and foot)
% and for characters in the Special font.

% EXTRAS is for "Special" characters that are actually in a
% PostScript text face, so that they can be remapped independant
% of ROMAN or SYMBOL if necessary.

% FACENAMES specifies the intended names of the
% generated troff faces (one or two letters each)
% Files named ftXX.c (where XX is the face name) will be
% generated that, when compiled, are used by troff as width
% tables.
