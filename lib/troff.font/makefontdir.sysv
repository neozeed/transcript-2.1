# This script moves the font files for a font family into a target
# directory.  It also make some links.  It is used to create [o]troff
# font family directories.
# The font family directories are always created in /usr/lib/font/ps, because
# otroff is hard-wired to look there.

# Args: family-name


family=$1
target=/usr/lib/font/ps/$1

# Set up the rest of the args:  R-font  I-font  B-font  S-font
set $1 `awk -f doto.awk $family.map`

# Get the overhead files
cp $family.ct $target/font.ct
cp font.head $target
# Inhibit ligatures for Courier font -- looks better without them.
if test x"$family" = xCourier
then
    echo ".lg 0" >>$target/font.head

# Get the font files
cp $2 $3 $4 $5 $target
rm $2 $3 $4 $5

# Make links for R/I/B fonts.

ln $2 ftR
ln $3 ftI
ln $4 ftB
